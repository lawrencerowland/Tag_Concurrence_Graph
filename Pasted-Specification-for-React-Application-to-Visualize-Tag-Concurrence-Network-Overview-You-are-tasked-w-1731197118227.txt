Specification for React Application to Visualize Tag Concurrence Network

Overview

You are tasked with developing a web-based visualization tool using React and react-cytoscapejs. This tool will visualize tag concurrence from a JSON dataset, providing an interactive and aesthetically pleasing graph representation that minimizes clutter and maximizes usability. The goal is to make tag relationships clear through an intuitive user interface.

Technology Stack:

React for the frontend framework.

react-cytoscapejs for graph visualization.

JavaScript/TypeScript for logic and component structure.

CSS or SCSS for custom styling.

Node.js & npm for package management.

Functional Requirements

Data Loading:

Load the JSON file containing the network data (nodes and edges) either locally or from a provided endpoint.

Parse and prepare the data to feed into Cytoscape for visualization.

Graph Visualization:

Use react-cytoscapejs to render the network graph.

Display nodes (tags) and edges (concurrence relationships between tags) with appropriate weights.

Nodes should be styled differently depending on their significance (e.g., using size or color to indicate frequency).

Use a force-directed layout (fcose or cola) to minimize edge overlap and present a readable structure.

Interactivity:

Enable zooming, panning, and dragging for better exploration of the graph.

Allow node selection to highlight connected edges and nodes, making it easy to explore relationships.

Display node information (tag name, concurrence count, etc.) when hovering or clicking on a node.

Customization and Filtering:

Provide controls to filter nodes and edges based on edge weight (e.g., hide low-weight edges).

Option to switch between different layouts (e.g., grid, cose, fcose) for better analysis of graph structure.

Styling:

Nodes should have visually distinct colors and labels to differentiate them.

Edges should vary in thickness based on their weight to signify strength of concurrence.

The UI should be responsive, allowing for graph resizing depending on viewport size.

Component Structure

App.js (Main Application):

Import necessary libraries (React, Cytoscape, JSON data).

Load the JSON data upon initialization.

Pass the data as props to the Graph component.

Manage state related to node/edge filters.

GraphComponent.js (Graph Rendering):

Import react-cytoscapejs.

Accept nodes and edges as props from App.js.

Configure the Cytoscape component:

Use the fcose layout initially, with options for other layouts.

Define node and edge styling (color, size, labels).

Attach interactivity logic (hover, click).

ControlPanel.js (Optional):

Include UI elements to filter the graph (slider to adjust minimum edge weight).

Allow layout switching and resetting zoom.

styles.css:

Style the main container and control panel for optimal UX.

Define styles for nodes (e.g., frequently connected tags could be larger or differently colored).

Ensure consistency between the overall page style and the Cytoscape component.

Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

The graph should be able to handle at least 500 nodes and 1000 edges without significant lag.

Use efficient JSON parsing and data loading strategies.

Accessibility:

Ensure keyboard navigation is supported (e.g., tab through control elements).

Use accessible colors for color-blind users.

Deployment:

The application should be deployable using popular platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

Use a simple build process (npm run build) for easy deployment.

Deliverables

React Application Source Code: Including App.js, GraphComponent.js, optional ControlPanel.js, and styling files.

README: Instructions on how to set up the project locally, including dependencies and running commands.

Deployment URL (optional): A link to a live version of the app deployed on a service like Netlify/Vercel.

Suggested Libraries

react-cytoscapejs: For rendering the network graph.

axios or fetch API: For data loading (if required from a server).

Material-UI or similar: For building the UI components like sliders and buttons.

Acceptance Criteria

The graph visualization is clear, with minimal overlapping of nodes and edges.

Nodes and edges should visually indicate their weights and significance.

The user should be able to interact (click, hover, zoom) with the graph smoothly.

Filtering and layout options should be functional and improve graph usability.
